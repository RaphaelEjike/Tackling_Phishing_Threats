# Tackling Phishing Threats
Most companies have strong perimeter defences and adopt advanced strategies like Zero Trust network models. They manage patches effectively, conduct regular employee training, and run tabletop exercises and simulations for their Incident Response (IR) teams. Yet, despite these defences, cyber-attacks still occur why, because attacks can bypass even the best security measures, all it takes is a user clicking on a phishing email. So in addition to user awareness training and leveraging the MITRE ATT&CK framework, there are several technical and procedural strategies that can help mitigate phishing attacks, which are often the gateway to malicous software like ransomware. Here are some effective measures:

1. Email Security Solutions (Secure Email Gateways - SEG)
2. Advanced Threat Protection (ATP)
3. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
4. Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)
5. DNS Filtering
6. File Type Restrictions
7. Zero Trust Architecture
8. Threat Intelligence Integration
9. Domain-Based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance (DMARC)
10. Endpoint Hardening
11. Segmentation of Network Access
12. User Reporting Mechanisms
13. Machine Learning and AI for Phishing Detection


## Email Security Solutions (Secure Email Gateways - SEG)
### Overview
Email security is a critical aspect of protecting an organization’s communication infrastructure. Secure Email Gateways (SEGs) are essential tools that help filter and block malicious emails before they reach users’ inboxes. This guide covers the deployment of robust SEGs and the use of Content Disarm and Reconstruction (CDR) technology to enhance email security.
### Deploying a Secure Email Gateway
A Secure Email Gateway (SEG) inspects and filters email traffic for potentially malicious, dangerous, or inappropriate content. Here are the steps to deploy a robust SEG:

1. Choose the Right SEG Tool
Select a reliable SEG tool such as Proofpoint, Mimecast, or Microsoft Defender for Office 365. These tools offer comprehensive protection by blocking malicious attachments, URLs, and suspicious sender domains.

2. Configure Email Filtering
Set up filtering rules based on:

- Reputation: Block emails from known malicious domains.
- Attachment Type: Restrict certain file types that are commonly used to deliver malware (e.g., .exe, .zip).
- Content Analysis: Use machine learning and threat intelligence to detect and block phishing attempts and other malicious content.

#### Example Configuration Script

Here’s an example PowerShell script to configure email filtering in Microsoft Defender for Office 365:

```
# Connect to Exchange Online
Connect-ExchangeOnline -UserPrincipalName admin@yourdomain.com

# Create a new malware filter policy
New-MalwareFilterPolicy -Name "BlockMaliciousAttachments" -Action DeleteMessage -EnableFileFilter $true -FileTypes "exe","zip"

# Apply the malware filter policy to a rule
New-MalwareFilterRule -Name "ApplyMalwareFilter" -MalwareFilterPolicy "BlockMaliciousAttachments" -RecipientDomainIs "yourdomain.com"

# Disconnect from Exchange Online
Disconnect-ExchangeOnline -Confirm:$false
```
#### Conclusion
Implementing a Secure Email Gateway and leveraging Content Disarm and Reconstruction technology are crucial steps in enhancing your organization’s email security

## Advanced Threat Protection (ATP)
### Overview
Advanced Threat Protection (ATP) is essential for safeguarding your organization against sophisticated cyber threats. ATP solutions provide comprehensive protection by analyzing email attachments and URLs for malicious behavior before they reach users. This guide covers the implementation of sandboxing solutions and real-time scanning services to enhance your email security.

### Implementing Sandboxing Solutions
Sandboxing solutions analyze email attachments in an isolated environment to detect malicious behavior. This ensures that threats are identified and mitigated before they can harm your network

### How Sandboxing Works

1. Isolation: The attachment is executed in a controlled, isolated environment.
2. Behavior Analysis: The sandbox monitors the attachment’s behavior for any signs of malicious activity.
3. Verdict: Based on the analysis, the attachment is either flagged as safe or malicious.


### Utilizing Attachment and URL Scanning Services

Attachment and URL scanning services provide real-time protection by scanning files and links for malicious content or phishing attempts before they execute.

### How Real-Time Scanning Works

1. Attachment Scanning: The service scans email attachments for malware and other threats.
2. URL Scanning: The service checks URLs in emails for phishing attempts and malicious content.

### Example Configuration for Microsoft Defender for Office 365

Here’s an example PowerShell script to configure Safe Attachments and Safe Links in Microsoft Defender for Office 365:
```
# Connect to Exchange Online
Connect-ExchangeOnline -UserPrincipalName admin@yourdomain.com

# Create a Safe Attachments policy
New-SafeAttachmentPolicy -Name "SafeAttachmentsPolicy" -Action Block -Enable $true

# Apply the Safe Attachments policy to a rule
New-SafeAttachmentRule -Name "ApplySafeAttachments" -SafeAttachmentPolicy "SafeAttachmentsPolicy" -RecipientDomainIs "yourdomain.com"

# Create a Safe Links policy
New-SafeLinksPolicy -Name "SafeLinksPolicy" -EnableForEmail $true -EnableForOffice $true

# Apply the Safe Links policy to a rule
New-SafeLinksRule -Name "ApplySafeLinks" -SafeLinksPolicy "SafeLinksPolicy" -RecipientDomainIs "yourdomain.com"

# Disconnect from Exchange Online
Disconnect-ExchangeOnline -Confirm:$false

```
