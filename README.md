SPF allows domain owners to specify which mail servers are permitted to send emails on behalf of their domain. This helps prevent unauthorized senders from forging emails.

### Example SPF Record
Here’s an example of an SPF record for a domain:

```
v=spf1 include:spf.protection.outlook.com -all
```
ii) DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM)
DKIM adds a digital signature to emails, allowing the recipient’s mail server to verify that the email was sent from an authorized server and that it hasn’t been altered during transit.

Example DKIM Configuration
To set up DKIM, you need to generate a public-private key pair and publish the public key in your DNS records. Here’s an example of a DKIM DNS record:

```
default._domainkey.yourdomain.com IN TXT "v=DKIM1; k=rsa; p=your_public_key"

```

### Domain-Based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance (DMARC)
iii) DMARC builds on SPF and DKIM by adding a policy that instructs receiving mail servers on how to handle emails that fail authentication checks. It also provides reporting capabilities to monitor and improve email authentication.

### Example DMARC Record
Here’s an example of a DMARC record for a domain:

```
v=DMARC1; p=reject; rua=mailto:dmarc-reports@yourdomain.com; ruf=mailto:dmarc-failures@yourdomain.com; fo=1
```

### How to Implement DMARC, DKIM, and SPF
i) Create DNS Records: Add the SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records to your domain’s DNS settings.

ii) Monitor Reports: Use the reporting capabilities of DMARC to monitor authentication results and adjust policies as needed.
