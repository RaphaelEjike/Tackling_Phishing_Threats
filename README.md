2. Use Least Privilege Access: Limit user access to only what is necessary for their role, reducing the potential impact of compromised accounts.
3. Assume Breach: Design systems with the assumption that a breach has already occurred, and segment access to minimize damage.


### How to Implement Zero Trust Access Control

1. Identity Verification: Continuously verify user identities using multi-factor authentication (MFA) and other identity management solutions.
2. Device Health Checks: Ensure that devices meet security standards before granting access.
3. Access Policies: Create and enforce policies that define who can access what resources under which conditions.

### Example Configuration for Microsoft Azure AD Conditional Access

Here’s an example PowerShell script to configure Zero Trust access control using Microsoft Azure AD Conditional Access:

```
# Connect to Azure AD
Connect-AzureAD

# Create a new Conditional Access policy
$policy = New-Object -TypeName Microsoft.Open.AzureAD.Model.ConditionalAccessPolicy
$policy.DisplayName = "Zero Trust Access Policy"
$policy.State = "Enabled"
$policy.Conditions = New-Object -TypeName Microsoft.Open.AzureAD.Model.ConditionalAccessConditionSet

# Define user and group conditions
$policy.Conditions.Users = New-Object -TypeName Microsoft.Open.AzureAD.Model.ConditionalAccessUsers
$policy.Conditions.Users.IncludeUsers = @("All")
$policy.Conditions.Users.IncludeGroups = @("All")

# Define device conditions
$policy.Conditions.Devices = New-Object -TypeName Microsoft.Open.AzureAD.Model.ConditionalAccessDevices
$policy.Conditions.Devices.IncludeDeviceStates = @("Compliant")

# Define access controls
$policy.GrantControls = New-Object -TypeName Microsoft.Open.AzureAD.Model.ConditionalAccessGrantControls
$policy.GrantControls.BuiltInControls = @("Mfa")

# Apply the policy
New-AzureADMSConditionalAccessPolicy -ConditionalAccessPolicy $policy

# Disconnect from Azure AD
Disconnect-AzureAD
```
